    abstract = {We propose a method of assessing a prior distribution for the correlation coefficient in a bivariate normal distribution using the probabilities of “concordance” and exceedance“. We carried out an experiment in which we studied and compared assessments based on these two probabilities, and we found that use of concordance probability is to be preferred to that of exceedance probability. The method worked well empirically.},
