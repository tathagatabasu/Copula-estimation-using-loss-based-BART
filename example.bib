    abstract = {We propose a method of assessing a prior distribution for the correlation coefficient in a bivariate normal distribution using the probabilities of “concordance” and exceedance“. We carried out an experiment in which we studied and compared assessments based on these two probabilities, and we found that use of concordance probability is to be preferred to that of exceedance probability. The method worked well empirically.},

abstract = {We test for asymmetry in a model of the dependence between the Deutsche mark and the yen, in the sense that a different degree of correlation is exhibited during joint appreciations against the U.S. dollar versus during joint depreciations. We consider an extension of the theory of copulas to allow for conditioning variables, and employ it to construct flexible models of the conditional dependence structure of these exchange rates. We find evidence that the mark–dollar and yen–dollar exchange rates are more correlated when they are depreciating against the dollar than when they are appreciating.},
