From this perspective, we introduce and study convex risk measures for portfolio vectors defined axiomatically and further introduce two natural and easy to interprete and calculate classes of examples of risk measures for portfolio vectors and investigate their consistency properties.}

The model is implemented with a GJR-GARCH-MA-t model for the marginal distributions and the Gaussian copula for the joint distribution, which allows capturing time-varying, non-linear relationships. The results show that, within the Euro area, market dependence increased after the introduction of the common currency only for large equity markets, such as in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Structural break tests indicate that the increase in financial market dependence started around the beginning of 1998 when Euro membership was determined and the relevant information was announced. The UK and Sweden, but not other European countries outside the Euro area, are found to exhibit an increase in equity market co-movement, which is consistent with the interpretation that these countries may be expected to join the Euro in the future.}

When returns are non-normal, it is often simply impossible to specify the multivariate distribution relating two or more return series. In this context, we propose a new methodology based on copula functions, which consists in estimating first the univariate distributions and then the joining distribution. In such a context, the dependency parameter can easily be rendered conditional and time varying. We apply this methodology to the daily returns of four major stock markets. Our results suggest that conditional dependency depends on past realizations for European market pairs only. For these markets, dependency is found to be more widely affected when returns move in the same direction than when they move in opposite directions. Modeling the dynamics of the dependency parameter also suggests that dependency is higher and more persistent between European stock markets.}

 abstract = {The study of dependence between random variables is a mainstay in statistics. In many cases, the strength of dependence between two or more random variables varies according to the values of a measured covariate. We propose inference for this type of variation using a conditional copula model where the copula function belongs to a parametric copula family and the copula parameter varies with the covariate. In order to estimate the functional relationship between the copula parameter and the covariate, we propose a nonparametric approach based on local likelihood. Of importance is also the choice of the copula family that best represents a given set of data. The proposed framework naturally leads to a novel copula selection method based on cross-validated prediction errors. We derive the asymptotic bias and variance of the resulting local polynomial estimator, and outline how to construct pointwise confidence intervals. The finite-sample performance of our method is investigated using simulation studies and is illustrated using a subset of the Matched Multiple Birth data.},

abstract = {The manner in which two random variables influence one another often depends on covariates. A way to model this dependence is via a conditional copula function. This paper contributes to the study of semiparametric estimation of conditional copulas by starting from a parametric copula function in which the parameter varies with a covariate, and leaving the marginals unspecified. Consequently, the unknown parts in the model are the parameter function and the unknown marginals. The authors use a local pseudo-likelihood with nonparametrically estimated marginals approximating the unknown parameter function locally by a polynomial. Under this general setting, they prove the consistency of the estimators of the parameter function as well as its derivatives; they also establish asymptotic normality. Furthermore, they derive an expression for the theoretical optimal bandwidth and discuss practical bandwidth selection. They illustrate the performance of the estimation procedure with data-driven bandwidth selection via a simulation study and a real-data case.}

abstract = {One way to model a dependence structure is through the copula function which is a mean to capture the dependence structure in the joint distribution of variables. Association measures such as Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rho can be expressed as functionals of the copula. The dependence structure between two variables can be highly influenced by a covariate, and it is of real interest to know how this dependence structure changes with the value taken by the covariate. This motivates the need for introducing conditional copulas, and the associated conditional Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho association measures. After the introduction and motivation of these concepts, two nonparametric estimators for a conditional copula are proposed and discussed. Then nonparametric estimates for the conditional association measures are derived. A key issue is that these measures are now looked at as functions in the covariate. The performances of all estimators are investigated via a simulation study which also includes a data-driven algorithm for choosing the smoothing parameters. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated on two real data examples.}

Considering the national merit twin study, our purpose is to analyse correctly the influence of socio-economic status on the relationship between twins’ cognitive abilities. Our methodology is based on conditional copulas, which enable us to model the effect of a covariate driving the strength of dependence between the main variables. We propose a flexible Bayesian non-parametric approach for the estimation of conditional copulas, which can model any conditional copula density. Our methodology extends the work of Wu, Wang and Walker in 2015 by introducing dependence from a covariate in an infinite mixture model. Our results suggest that environmental factors are more influential in families with lower socio-economic position.},

abstract = {Copula models are flexible tools to represent complex structures of dependence for multivariate random variables. According to Sklar's theorem, any multidimensional absolutely continuous distribution function can be uniquely represented as a copula, i.e. a joint cumulative distribution function on the unit hypercube with uniform marginals, which captures the dependence structure among the vector components. In real data applications, the interest of the analyses often lies on specific functionals of the dependence, which quantify aspects of it in a few numerical values. A broad literature exists on such functionals, however extensions to include covariates are still limited. This is mainly due to the lack of unbiased estimators of the conditional copula, especially when one does not have enough information to select the copula model. Several Bayesian methods to approximate the posterior distribution of functionals of the dependence varying according covariates are presented and compared; the main advantage of the investigated methods is that they use nonparametric models, avoiding the selection of the copula, which is usually a delicate aspect of copula modelling. These methods are compared in simulation studies and in two realistic applications, from civil engineering and astrophysics.}

Software is also readily available for such outcomes. In this article, we introduce modeling that extends the usefulness of BART in medical applications by addressing needs arising in survival analysis. Simulation studies of one-sample and two-sample scenarios, in comparison with long-standing traditional methods, establish face validity of the new approach. We then demonstrate the model's ability to accommodate data from complex regression models with a simulation study of a nonproportional hazards scenario with crossing survival functions and survival function estimation in a scenario where hazards are multiplicatively modified by a highly nonlinear function of the covariates. Using data from a recently published study of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we illustrate the use and some advantages of the proposed method in medical investigations.

abstract = {Abstract This paper demonstrates the advantages of sharing information about unknown features of covariates across multiple model components in various nonparametric regression problems including multivariate, heteroscedastic, and semicontinuous responses. In this paper, we present a methodology which allows for information to be shared nonparametrically across various model components using Bayesian sum-of-tree models. Our simulation results demonstrate that sharing of information across related model components is often very beneficial, particularly in sparse high-dimensional problems in which variable selection must be conducted. We illustrate our methodology by analyzing medical expenditure data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). To facilitate the Bayesian nonparametric regression analysis, we develop two novel models for analyzing the MEPS data using Bayesian additive regression trees—a heteroskedastic log-normal hurdle model with a “shrink-toward-homoskedasticity” prior and a gamma hurdle model.},

 abstract = {We present advances in Bayesian modeling and computation for CART (classification and regression tree) models. The modeling innovations include a formal prior distributional structure for tree generation—the pinball prior—that allows for the combination of an explicit specification of a distribution for both the tree size and the tree shape. The core computational innovations involve a novel Metropolis—Hastings method that can dramatically improve the convergence and mixing properties of MCMC methods of Bayesian CART analysis. Earlier MCMC methods have simulated Bayesian CART models using very local MCMC moves, proposing only small changes to a "current" CART model. Our new Metropolis—Hastings move makes large changes in the CART tree, but is at the same time local in that it leaves unchanged the partition of observations into terminal nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two examples, one with a constructed data set and one concerning analysis of a published breast cancer dataset.},

 abstract = {Since their inception in the 1980s, regression trees have been one of the more widely used nonparametric prediction methods. Tree-structured methods yield a histogram reconstruction of the regression surface, where the bins correspond to terminal nodes of recursive partitioning. Trees are powerful, yet susceptible to overfitting. Strategies against overfitting have traditionally relied on pruning greedily grown trees. The Bayesian framework offers an alternative remedy against overfitting through priors. Roughly speaking, a good prior charges smaller trees where overfitting does not occur. While the consistency of random histograms, trees and their ensembles has been studied quite extensively, the theoretical understanding of the Bayesian counterparts has been missing. In this paper, we take a step toward understanding why/when do Bayesian trees and forests not overfit. To address this question, we study the speed at which the posterior concentrates around the true smooth regression function. We propose a spike-and-tree variant of the popular Bayesian CART prior and establish new theoretical results showing that regression trees (and forests) (a) are capable of recovering smooth regression surfaces (with smoothness not exceeding one), achieving optimal rates up to a log factor, (b) can adapt to the unknown level of smoothness and (c) can perform effective dimension reduction when p > n. These results provide a piece of missing theoretical evidence explaining why Bayesian trees (and additive variants thereof) have worked so well in practice.},

abstract = {Abstract We discuss the problem of selecting among alternative parametric models within the Bayesian framework. For model selection problems, which involve non-nested models, the common objective choice of a prior on the model space is the uniform distribution. The same applies to situations where the models are nested. It is our contention that assigning equal prior probability to each model is over simplistic. Consequently, we introduce a novel approach to objectively determine model prior probabilities, conditionally, on the choice of priors for the parameters of the models. The idea is based on the notion of the worth of having each model within the selection process. At the heart of the procedure is the measure of this worth using the Kullback–Leibler divergence between densities from different models.},
